An Introduction to Design Thinking – PROCESS GUIDE

WHAT is the Empathize mode
Empathy is the centerpiece of a human-centered design process. The Empathize mode is
the work you do to understand people within the context of your design challenge. It is your
effort to understand the way they do things and why, their physical and emotional needs,
how they think about the world, and what is meaningful to them.

WHY empathize
As a design thinker, the problems you are trying to solve are rarely your own – they are those of
a particular group of people; in order to design for them, you must gain empathy for who they
are and what is important to them.

Observing what people do and how they interact with their environment gives you clues about
what they think and feel. It also helps you learn about what they need. By watching people,
you can capture physical manifestations of their experiences – what they do and say – and infer
the intangible meaning of those experiences to uncover insights.

Engaging with people directly reveals a tremendous amount about the way they think and the
values they hold. The stories that people tell and the things that people say they do—even if
they differ from what they actually do—are indicators of their deeply held beliefs.

HOW to empathize
- Observe users and their behavior in context.
- Engage in conversations and ask “Why?”.
- Watch and listen while users perform tasks and explain their thinking.

Transition: Empathize >> Define
After empathy work, unpack and externalize what you saw and heard: post pictures, quotes,
journey maps, and observations to start connecting dots and preparing synthesis.

WHAT is the Define mode
The Define mode brings clarity and focus to the design space. It is about making sense of all
the information you gathered and crafting a meaningful, actionable problem statement – a
point-of-view (POV) rooted in user needs and insights.

WHY define
The Define mode is critical because your POV expresses the right challenge to tackle. A more
narrowly focused problem statement usually leads to more and better ideas during ideation.
It also synthesizes scattered findings into powerful insights that only you (as the design team)
have discovered.

HOW to define
- Identify patterns and interesting moments from your research.
- Clarify who your user is.
- Distill and select the most important needs.
- Express the insights you’ve developed from your empathy work.
Combine user + need + insight into an actionable POV statement.

A good POV:
- Provides focus and frames the problem.
- Inspires the team.
- Informs criteria for evaluating ideas.
- Empowers parallel decision-making.
- Captures hearts and minds.
- Is discrete (not too broad).

Transition: Define >> Ideate
From a strong POV, generate a set of “How might we…?” questions. These become focused
brainstorming prompts that each address aspects of the challenge.

WHAT is the Ideate mode
Ideate is the mode where you generate a wide range of ideas. It is about “going wide”
conceptually before narrowing later through prototyping and testing.

WHY ideate
Ideation helps you:
- Go beyond obvious solutions.
- Leverage the diversity of your team.
- Discover unexpected areas.
- Create volume and variety in solution options.
- Get the obvious out of your heads and reach novel ideas.

HOW to ideate
Use techniques like brainstorming, mindmapping, sketching, bodystorming, or prototyping
as a thinking tool. Defer judgment: separate idea generation from evaluation to allow
creativity and imagination to surface.

Transition: Ideate >> Prototype
Select multiple promising ideas rather than just one. Use voting criteria like “most likely to
delight”, “most rational”, or “most unexpected”, and carry two or three concepts into
prototyping to preserve innovation potential.

WHAT is the Prototype mode
A prototype is any artifact a user can interact with that helps answer questions and test key
assumptions. Early prototypes are quick, low-resolution, and inexpensive; later ones become
more refined and specific.

WHY prototype
- Build to think and problem-solve.
- Communicate ideas more clearly than words alone.
- Start richer conversations with users.
- Fail quickly and cheaply.
- Test possibilities without overcommitting.
- Break big problems into smaller, testable components.

HOW to prototype
- Start building quickly with simple materials.
- Avoid overworking one prototype so you don’t get attached.
- Identify what variable or question each prototype is meant to test.
- Build with the user and context in mind.

Transition: Prototype >> Test
Prototype and Test work hand in hand. Think deliberately about how you will test each
prototype so that users can give natural, honest feedback.

WHAT is the Test mode
In Test mode, you solicit feedback on your prototypes and gain additional empathy. Testing
is not just about asking if users like something; it’s about learning more about them, their
behaviors, and the problem.

WHY test
- Refine and improve prototypes and solutions.
- Learn more about users and their context.
- Sometimes realize the problem was framed incorrectly and refine your POV.

HOW to test
- Show, don’t tell: let people experience the prototype with minimal explanation first.
- Create experiences that feel realistic or situational.
- Give users multiple prototypes to compare to surface latent needs and preferences.
- Ask “Why?” and observe behavior, not nur Aussagen.

Iteration and making the process your own
Design thinking is iterative. You can cycle multiple times through empathize, define, ideate,
prototype, and test, narrowing scope as you go from broad concepts to detailed solutions.
Over time, you adapt the process to your own style and work, but the core mindset remains:
stay user-centered, experimental, and reflective.
